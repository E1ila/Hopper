# Hopper
WoW Classic 1.13.2 Addon - Easy hopping between layers.

✅Detects layer change!
✅Auto leaves party after 2 seconds
✅You won't get "Player is already in group" spam
✅Supports the `/join layer` channel if no guildy is available, so you can use only this and remove other layer addons.

# Usage
* Download, extract and make sure folder doesn't have `-master` postfix.
* Place in your `Interface/AddOns` folder
* Get your guild members to install this addon
* Write `/hop` to change layers
* Write `/hop to <player_name>` to move into another player's layer, if he has the addon installed.

# Notes
* It communicates with Hopper addon of other members of the guild (not in chat)
* You can request a `/hop` once in 10 seconds
* Once a guildy invited you, s/he won't invite you again for 20 minutes
* If you're in a party, it will not auto leave it, unless you enable Auto Party Leave `/hop l`
* If you're a party leader, it will not auto invite requestors unless youo enable Party Add `/hop p`
* For `/hop to <player>` the target player doesn't have to be in a guild
